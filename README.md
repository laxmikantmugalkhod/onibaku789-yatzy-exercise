# Yatzy Java Implementation

This project provides a Java-based implementation of the Yatzy dice game scoring system. It supports calculating scores for different Yatzy categories based on the given dice rolls..

#Enhancements Made

- Implemented core scoring logic using clean, functional-style Java.
- Added methods for each Yatzy category (e.g., `ones()`, `twos()`, `threeOfAKind()`, etc.).
- Comprehensive test cases written using JUnit.
- Code refactored for readability and maintainability.
- Java Stream API used for concise logic and improved performance.
- Comprehensive unit tests written with JUnit to ensure correctness of each scoring method.

# How to Run Tests

# Using IDE:
- Right-click the test class (e.g., `YatzyTest`) and select Run.

# Requirements
